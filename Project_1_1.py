# Analyzing Customer Orders Using Python
# ===============================

# Task 1: Create a list of customer orders & Store the orders
#customer's order details (customer name, product, price, category) as tuples inside a list
# Dictionary is used, where keys are customer names and values are lists of ordered products

# Each order = (customer name, product, price, category)
orders = [
    ("John", "Laptop", 900, "Electronics"),
    ("John", "Headphones", 50, "Electronics"),

    ("Michael", "Vacuum Cleaner", 120, "Home Essentials"),
    ("Michael", "Laptop", 900, "Electronics"),
    ("Danny", "Notebook", 10, "Home Essentials"),
    ("Danny", "Pen", 5, "Home Essentials"),
    ("Amy", "Smartphone", 700, "Electronics"),
    ("Amy", "Dress", 60, "Clothing")

# Dictionary: customer -> list of orders (product, price, category)

    customer_orders.setdefault(name, []).append((product, price, category))


# Task 2: Classify products by category ---
# Dictionary: product -> category
product_category = {product: category for _, product, _, category in orders}

# Unique product categories
categories = set(product_category.values())
print("âœ… Available Product Categories:", categories)


# Task 3: Analyze customer spending & classification ---
customer_spending = {}
customer_classification = {}

    total = sum(price for _, price, _ in items)
    customer_spending[customer] = total

#Task 4: Generate business insights
# Revenue per category

    category_revenue[category] = category_revenue.get(category, 0) + price

# Unique products across all orders

multi_category_customers = {name for name, items in customer_orders.items()
                            if len({cat for _, _, cat in items}) > 1}

# Customers who purchased both electronics and clothing

# --- Step 5: Display results ---
